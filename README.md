# ENZO'S CHAT AGENT
Chat Agent MVP developed for Cloudflare's Software Engineering Intern application.
Deployed link: https://chat-agent.j-enzosagun.workers.dev

## HOW TO USE THE FEATURES!
1) When you first open the link, you're prompted to put in your name! Just type what you'd like the chat agent to refer to you as before starting the actual application.
2) At the top right corner, you will see four different dots. These are color themes! Select any one of these to change the colors of the application. There's Cloudflare (heyyy), blue, pinkish, and a light version of Cloudflare.
3) You can also make other chat windows! At the top of the textbox, you can see a (+). Press on it and write a title for the next chat, and then start typing away!
